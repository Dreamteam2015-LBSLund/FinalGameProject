This will serve as a rule book for all those who contribute.

## 1 Tom's Rights

##### 1.1 Don't bully Tom
Just because you don't understand his opinons doesn't mean he is stuipd. His spelling is, though.

##### 1.2 Tom's code is not spaghetti, it is post-spaghetti
Post-spaghetti is the application of post-structalism on code structure. Nobody knows what that means.

##### 1.3 Ruben can't bully Tom but Tom can bully him
Bully equals power and borgarf√∂reldrar, therefore Tom can't bully. This doesn't make sense. Tom can bully and Ruben can't, but Ruben is a bully and Tom isn't?

## 2 Johannes' Rights
He can do whatever he wants, since Tom doesn't controll him. Especially in bullying matters.

##### 2.1 Ruben's spaghetti
Ruben complaines so much about Tom's spaghetti that it overshadows his own spaghetti, and that's a good thing.
